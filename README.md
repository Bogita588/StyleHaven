🛍️ Project Title: StyleHaven – A Premium Frontend Fashion Store

🎯 Project Vision
StyleHaven is a fully functional, visually stunning, and front-end-only fashion eCommerce platform. It simulates a complete shopping experience—from product discovery and outfit suggestions to cart, checkout, and admin management—using mock APIs and Stripe integration.
The project is built using React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, Material UI, and vanilla CSS, designed to push the boundaries of front-end development without requiring a backend.
